/**
 * @class Inst
 * This class represents assembly instructions of a piece of code.
 * As they must represents a large set of machine language that may contain
 * unusual instruction, they provide a very generic way to access information
 * about the instruction.
 *
 * @ref Inst is basically an abstract class that does not provide any facilities (except
 * linkage with other instruction). To be actually used, it has to be subclassed by the
 * loader to an actual instruction of the loader instruction set.
 *
 * Depending on the features provided by the loader, only several or all of its functions
 * are implemented. If an unimplemented function is called, an exception
 * @ref UnsupportedFeatureException is raised. The supported feature of the loader
 * are set on the @ref Process and automatically transfered to the @ref Workspace using
 * the @ref Process. Therefore, they can be tested using the function @ref WorkSpace::isProvided().
 *
 * The loader features and the corresponding @ref Inst functions are listed below:
 * * @ref CONTROL_DECODING_FEATURE -- @ref Inst::target()
 * * @ref REGISTER_USAGE_FEATURE -- @ref Inst::readRegSet(), @ref Inst::writeRegSet().
 * * @ref SEMANTICS_INFO -- @ref Inst::semInsts().
 * * @ref DELAYED_FEATURE -- @ref Inst::delayType(), @ref Inst::delaySlots.
 * * @ref CONDITIONAL_INSTRUCTIONS_FEATURE -- @ref Inst::condition(), @ref Inst::updateCondition(),
 * * @ref VLIW_FEATURE -- @ref Inst::bundle()/
 *
 * Notice that the availability of a feature does not always mean that the corresponding
 * loader is incomplete. If @ref DELAYED_FEATURE and @ref CONDITIONAL_INSTRUCTIONS_FEATURE
 * are not provided, the instruction does not provide these facilties.
 *
 * @section proc_vliw VLIW Support
 * 
 * Very-Long Instruction Word (VLIW) architectures encodes Instruction Level
 * Parallelism (ILP) in the instruction themselves: in fact, the scheduling of
 * instructions is done by the compiler. Instructions are grouped by bundles
 * and the bundle traverses the processor pipeline as a unitary instruction.
 * 
 * To support the bundle, the new version of OTAWA considers the bundle as a
 * single instruction and the program loader in charge of the VLIW architecture
 * has to translate the effects of the instructions composing the bundle as
 * a single instruction. Yet, the individual instruction are still reachable
 * with the function @ref Inst::bundle(). This function may be useful for
 * the display of the instructions but considering the instruction bundle as
 * a single instructions prevent support of VLIW for other OTAWA analyses.
 * 
 * To detect if the underlying architecture of a @ref otawa::Process supports
 * VLIW instructions, the feature @ref otawa::VLIW_FEATURE is provided.
 * 
 * Notice that the previous API using the flag Inst::IS_BUNDLE to mark the end of
 * bundle is now deprecated. The overall result is a significant simplification
 * of OTAWA API and of the implementation of analyses.
